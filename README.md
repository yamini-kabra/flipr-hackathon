Problem Statement 

India has 197 Total cases, out of which there are 4 deaths reported and 173 of 
those cases are still active. With a hope of controlling the epidemic, this 
machine learning problem is designed to cater the need of a prediction model 
that can predict the probability of a person getting infected by covid-19. 
The whole world is participating in a fight against this pandemic. The 
healthcare data science community can have a big impact on combating this 
disease. There have been many excellent efforts to use data 
visualization and monte carlo simulations to help combat the spread of this 
pandemic. The expected prediction model would address a complimentary 
and important aspect of health policy, identifying those most at risk. By 
combining the efforts of these and many other excellent efforts in the 
healthcare technology space, we hope to mitigate the effects of this terrible disease.

The objective of the first part of the problem statement is to predict the 
probability of a person getting infected by Covid-19 on 20th March 2020. The 
output file 01 should contain only people_ID and the respective infect_prob 
for the test data.

There are 3 files provided:
1. Variable_Description.xlsx : 
This file contains description of all the variables available in the dataset
2. Training_data.xlsx : 
This is the training dataset on which model has to be trained, which contains 
parameters of a person on 20th March 2020
3. Test_data.xlsx : 
This is the test data on which accuracy of the model will be computed
